# Hydra Library
#### The Last Minecraft Minigame Tool You'll Ever Need

##### Why should I use it?
Hydra gives you all the tools you need to develop the best Minigame you can think of with
the least amount of effort possible. The codebase is intuitive and feature rich. Need to
create a level? There is a level class, need to create the main game class? Extend the game 
class. Need to write game states? Use the GameState annotation.
